## Best Practices for Billboards Conversion

To get the most out of your image conversion, consider these best practices:

- **Maintain Originals**: Always keep a copy of the original BMP files in case they are needed in the future.
- **Use High Resolution**: For billboard display, always use the highest resolution possible.
- **Choose Correct Dimensions**: Ensure the dimensions of the PNG match the size of the billboard for optimal display.

## Technical Considerations Specific to Billboards

When converting images for billboards, keep the following in mind:

- **File Size**: Large billboards require high-resolution images, which result in larger file sizes. Ensure your storage and transfer methods can handle these larger files.
- **Color Space**: PNG uses RGB color space, ideal for screen display. Ensure your original BMP is also in RGB for accurate color conversion.
- **Compression**: While PNG offers lossless compression, inappropriate handling can still lead to quality loss. Always opt for the highest quality settings when converting.
